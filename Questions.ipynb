    "# Q1)) Differnece between continuous and discrete in machine learing\n",
    "# Ans--> Discrete variables are numeric or categorical features that can only take specific, separate values. These are countable values, often integers or categories. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "# ->Number of students in a class\n",
    "\n",
    "# ->Categorical labels like {Red, Green, Blue}\n",
    "# ->Shoe sizes (e.g. 7, 7.5), where there's no possibility of 7.3\n",
    "# Discrete features are typically represented using probability mass functions (PMFs) in statistical modeling \n",
    "#  Continuous Variables\n",
    "# Definition:\n",
    "# These are variables that can take any value within a range. \n",
    "#They are typically measured and can have infinite possible values.\n",
    "\n",
    "# -->Examples:\n",
    "#1) Height (e.g., 165.3 cm)\n",
    "#2)Weight (e.g., 55.8 kg)\n",
    "#3)Temperature (e.g., 36.7°C)\n",
    "#4)Time (e.g., 12.45 seconds)\n",
